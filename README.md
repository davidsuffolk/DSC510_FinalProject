# Weather Forecast APP in Python

This was created for a final project in a programming course. The goal was to build an interactive Python script that allows the user to type in a city and retrieve the latest weather forecast information. The information was pulled from an API and then displayed to the user in a formatted output. The script accounts for user errors and connection interruptions.
